// In your products.js, you will need to:

// import your data and your DOM generation function
// locate the list element where your products will go
// loop through your data
// Create a variable that is the singular of your domain list and assign based on the current array index. For example, const fruit = fruits[i];
// Pass to your DOM generation function and capture result in variable
// Append to the top-level list element
// git add, commit, push!

// THIS WILL HAVE THE FOR LOOP.
